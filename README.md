# 🌾 AgriCare AI: Crop Disease Detection & Advisory System (React Version)

This is the official repository for **AgriCare AI**, a web application designed to help farmers identify crop diseases using **Artificial Intelligence**. This version features a modern frontend built with **React** and **Vite**.

By uploading an image of a plant leaf, users get an instant diagnosis from a **deep learning model** and a detailed advisory report generated by the **Google Gemini API**.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Modern Frontend:** A fast, responsive, and animated user interface built with React.
- **AI-Powered Disease Detection:** Utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to identify 15 different plant diseases.
- **Instant Advisory Reports:** Generates comprehensive reports using the Google Gemini API.
- **Simple User Interface:** A clean and intuitive UI for easy image uploads.
- **Downloadable PDF Reports:** Users can download the generated advisory report as a PDF.

## 🚀 Full Setup Guide (From Scratch)

This guide provides all the necessary steps to clone, set up, and run this project on a new machine.

---

### ✅ Prerequisites

- **Git:** [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- **Python 3.11:** [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/)
- **Node.js:** [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **AI Model File:** You must have the trained model file `crop_disease_model.h5`

---

### 📦 Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone --branch react-version https://github.com/KushuCon/crop-disease-project.git
cd crop-disease-project
```

---

### 🧠 Step 2: Place the AI Model

- Navigate to `backend/models/` directory.
- Place your `crop_disease_model.h5` file inside this folder.

---

### 🐍 Step 3: Set Up the Backend

Open a terminal in the root project directory:

```bash
# Navigate to backend
cd backend

# Create and activate virtual environment
python3.11 -m venv venv

# On Windows:
.env\Scriptsctivate

# On Mac/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 🔐 Step 4: Configure Backend API Key

- Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) to get your free API key.
- Open the file `backend/app.py`
- Paste your key into the `YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY` variable.

---

### 💻 Step 5: Set Up the Frontend

Open a new terminal (separate from the backend one):

```bash
# Navigate to React frontend
cd react-frontend

# Install Node.js dependencies
npm install

# Install Tailwind CSS
npm install -D tailwindcss@^3.0.0 postcss autoprefixer

# Install drag-and-drop library
npm install react-dropzone
```

---

## ▶️ Running the Application

You need to have **two terminals** open simultaneously to run this project.

---

### Terminal 1: Start the Backend Server

```bash
# Make sure you're in the backend directory
# and the virtual environment is activated
python app.py
```

- The backend will run at: `http://127.0.0.1:5000`

---

### Terminal 2: Start the Frontend App

```bash
# Make sure you're in the react-frontend directory
npm run dev
```

- The frontend will run at: `http://localhost:5173`

---

### ✅ Access the App

Open your browser and go to:  
👉 **[http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)**

You're now ready to use **AgriCare AI** to detect crop diseases and generate expert advisory reports instantly!
