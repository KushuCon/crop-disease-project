AgriCare AI: Crop Disease Detection & Advisory System
AgriCare AI is a web-based application designed to help farmers in India identify crop diseases quickly and accurately. By uploading an image of a plant leaf, users can get an instant diagnosis powered by a deep learning model, along with a detailed advisory report generated by a large language model (LLM).
This project was developed as a final year B.Tech project to showcase the practical application of AI in solving real-world agricultural challenges.
‚ú® Features
AI-Powered Disease Detection: Utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the PlantVillage dataset to identify 15 different types of plant diseases.
Instant Advisory Reports: Generates comprehensive reports using the Google Gemini API, providing information on disease impact, cures (organic and chemical), and prevention strategies.
Simple User Interface: A clean, intuitive, and mobile-friendly web interface for easy image uploads.
No Signup Required: Allows for immediate use without the need for user accounts.
Downloadable PDF Reports: Users can download the generated advisory report as a PDF for offline reference.
üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
Backend: Python, Flask
Machine Learning: TensorFlow, Keras
Generative AI: Google Gemini API
Frontend: HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript
PDF Generation: FPDF2

üöÄ Setup and Installation
Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.
Prerequisites
Python 3.11: This project requires Python version 3.11. You can download it from the official Python website.
AI Model File: You must have the trained model file crop_disease_model.h5. Place this file inside the backend/models/ directory.
1. Clone the Repository
First, clone this project repository to your local machine.
git clone https://github.com/your-username/crop-disease-project.git
cd crop-disease-project


2. Set Up the Backend
The backend runs on Python and Flask. We will use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
# Navigate to the backend directory
cd backend

# Create a virtual environment using Python 3.11
python3.11 -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install the required Python packages
pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Configure API Key
The application uses the Google Gemini API to generate reports.
Go to Google AI Studio to get your free API key.
Open the backend/app.py file in a code editor.
Find the line YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY = "PASTE_YOUR_KEY_HERE" and replace "PASTE_YOUR_KEY_HERE" with your actual API key.
‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Application
1. Start the Backend Server
Make sure you are in the backend directory and your virtual environment (venv) is activated.
python app.py


The server will start, and you should see a message indicating it is running on http://127.0.0.1:5000.
2. Launch the Frontend
Navigate to the frontend folder and open the index.html file in your web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
The application is now running!
üìñ How to Use
The webpage will display an upload area.
Click the upload area to select an image of a plant leaf from your computer, or simply drag and drop an image file onto it.
Click the "Analyze with AI" button.
Wait for a few moments while the AI analyzes the image and generates a report.
The detailed advisory report will be displayed directly on the page.
Click the "Download PDF Report" button to save a copy of the report to your computer.
